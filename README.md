# Dota2-Ambient-Lights
Ambient Light effects for Dota2 using Game State Integration 


This was a personal project of mine as I had a LED strip lying around and I wanted to do something intresting with it.

I used an Arduino Uno to control the LEDs and C# for using the game state integration.

Thanks to @antonpup for his C# library for the Dota2GSI
